# Build My Own Reddit App

Site link: [alternareddit.netlify.app](https://alternareddit.netlify.app)

For this project, I built an application using the Reddit API. I utilized both APIs, the official one ([Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)) and the undocumented JSON API ([Reddit JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON)), for inspiration, but mostly relied on the JSON API because it doesnâ€™t require an OAuth workflow.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Built the application using React and Redux
- React-infinite-scroll-component(React component library)
- Version controlled the application with Git and hosted the repository on GitHub
- Bootstrap 5

## Features:

- Users can access my application at a URL
- Users can use the application on any modern browser
- Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)
- Users are shown a detailed view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item
- Users can filter the data based on predefined categories
- Users can search the data using terms
- Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app
- Users can use infinite scroll as a pagination method

## Future work:

- Write unit tests for my components using Jest/Enzyme
- Implement the Reddit pagination system
