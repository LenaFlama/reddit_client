​​Build My Own Reddit App

Site link: alternareddit.netlify.app

For this project I built an application using Reddit API. I used both APIs, the official one(https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and the undocumented JSON API(https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON) for inspiration but mostly the JSON API because it doesn’t require an OAuth workflow. 

Technologies used:

HTML;
CSS;
JavaScript;
Build the application using React and Redux;
Version control the application with Git and host the repository on GitHub;
Bootstrap 5;

Features:
Users can access my application at a URL;
Users can use the application on any modern browser;
Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile);
Users are shown a detailed view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item;
Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined;
Users can search the data using terms;
Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app;

Future work:

Write unit tests for my components using Jest/Enzyme;
Implement the reddit pagination system
